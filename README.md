# Feet

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/feet`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

    $ bundle add feet

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install feet

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Testing
`Rake::TestTask` was configure to run the test suite. You can see a list of Rake commands with `rake -T`.
Run all tests with:

```
rake test
```
Currently, the following tests are available:
- application_test.rb
- utils_test.rb
- file_model_test.rb
